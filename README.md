# Hello there! ✌️

👋 Hi, I'm Gonzalo, I'm currently specializing in mobile programming, specifically for android, I do not rule out in the future to develop for ios or desktop applications, I am studying the superior degree of multiplatform application development and previously I studied the medium degree of microcomputer systems and networks.

🏜️ I love to design and bring to reality user interfaces, on the other hand, I also like to create everything related to application servers, databases etc...

🎡 In my free time I like to create projects that make my life easier, for example, a telegram bot that reminds me every day something, home automation projects with the raspberry pi among others ... Some of them I will upload here.
